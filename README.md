# Virtual Bookshelf (Working Title)

------------

Project Idea: Virtual Bookshelf
Search and push up books to your virtual bookshelf through scanning or manually typing isbn #, author, title, or subject. 
We will be using GoodReads , Google Books, Ebay,  or some sort of pricing API. We are potentially looking for a barcode scanner API. 
The site will return some reviews and basic info about the books including its cover, prices from different sites for that book, then you will have an option to add this book to your bookshelf. We are looking to add a social aspect to it where your friends or followers can see the books that you read and what books you recommended.
